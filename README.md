2. **Data Collection** - Upload and explore datasets
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualize and understand data patterns
4. **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
5. **Feature Engineering** - Transform features and create new ones
6. **Data Splitting** - Prepare data for modeling
7. **Handle Imbalanced Data** - Apply techniques for imbalanced datasets
8. **Evaluation Metrics** - Understand how to evaluate your model
9. **Environment Setup** - Best practices for your ML environment
